# Wouldn't you like to add another friend to minecraft?
## That's exactly what this code does.

## The goal is to combine artificial intelligence and minecraft.

## Supported ai's:
- “Gemini 2.0 flash”

## ai's will be supported:
- gpt4
- deepseek
- claude
- ollama support

⚠️ You can manually add ai's that are not in this list.

My English is not very good so I apologize for any mistakes in the code.

Stay tuned for now
